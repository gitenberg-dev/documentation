= Welcome to the GITenberg documentation!

For more information about GITenberg, please see our https://gitenberg.github.io[website].

== How can you contribute?

We are currently working on converting and editing our first 100 books.  

* Help us link:how_to.asciidoc[format books] into link:sectioning.asciidoc[asciidoc]
* Suggest books we should improve
* Join our announcement list

For now there are a few things you can do depending on your interest and
skill level. Firstly, if you find an error or typo in any of the books,
report it in the 'Issues' tab on that repo. If you would like to offer
changes: fork, edit and create a Pull Request. If you would like to make
suggestions, help in another way, or would like to get more involved,
you can join the project
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gitenberg-project[mailing list].

file][active-repos]. Instructions on including a new repo are

== Open questions

=== How to generate covers for the books?

=== What will be the source format?

Discussion is still open, but asciidoc is the current best candidate.

=== How are the repositories created?

=== What is the reference format from PG?

=== How to cope with punctuation?

There is consensus to convert when possible ascii punctuation to unicode
more precise equivalents.

=== What is the licensing big schema?

=== What about Metadata?

==== How to read metadata from PG?

Eric Hellman is working to understand metadata dumps provided by PG. It
is a work in progress, and preliminary results are available in
https://gist.github.com/eshellman/40d85be01acf1172a5c1[this document].

==== How to archive metadata for gitenberg usage?

Ongoing discussion, current state
https://gist.github.com/eshellman/7a6d34c88e797b439938[here].

== Repositories

=== Books

Every book on PG gets its own repository. All are listed on the
gitenberg organization github page, https://github.com/GITenberg/[here].

The main gitenberg page, which is for the moment a developper's page, is
hosted http://gitenberg.github.io/[here], and its source is
https://github.com/GITenberg/gitenberg.github.com/blob/master/index.html[here].

=== Development

There is work going on on several repositories. The central point for
development is the gitenberg-dev organization, whose repos can be seen
on its github git@github.com:sethwoodworth/GITenberg.git[page].

There are other repositories in which some work for gitenberg happened:
https://github.com/sethwoodworth/GITenmake[gitenmake],
https://github.com/sethwoodworth/GITenberg[sethwoodworth/gitenberg]

== Readmes, introductions and FAQs

Several pieces of information are scattered around. This one is intended
to replace all of them but for the main gitemberg page, which serves as
first contact. All the others are being amended to point to this
document.

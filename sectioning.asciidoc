The projects preferred markup format is asciidoctor.org[Asciidoc].  
Asciidoc has a lot of great features, but denoting chapter and title information is the first step in making beautiful ebooks.


The title of the book should have a row of dashes underneath.  This turns into a Level one header +<h1>+

  Alice in Wonderland
  -------------------

Chapters should have two equals signs.  This turns into an +<h2>+ tag in html

  == Chapter 1
  Paragraph text &etc
  == Chapter 2

If the book is broken up into smaller subsections than chapters, you can use more equal signs:

  == Chapter 9
  === Section A

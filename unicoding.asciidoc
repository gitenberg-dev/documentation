GITenberg uses unicode characters for typography where appropriate.  
Common unicode characters that we use are curved quotes (aka &ldquo;smart quotes&rdquo;) and [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Common_dashes).

Contributor @rsperberg has written a script that will convert many of these characters automatically, available in the (https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/punctuation-cleanup)[gitenberg-dev/punctuation-cleanup] repo with instructions on use.

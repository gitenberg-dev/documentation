GITenberg uses unicode characters for typography where appropriate.  
Common unicode characters that we use are curved quotes, or &ldquo;smart quotes&rdquo;

Contributor @rsperberg has written a script that will convert many of these characters automatically, available in the (https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/scripts)[gitenberg-dev/scripts] repo with instructions on use.

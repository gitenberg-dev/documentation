The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding[character encoding] of GITenberg books 
should always be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[UTF-8] (aka Unicode).  
Project Gutenberg source files were often created before Unicode existed and need to be converted.

If you get an error like the following, you will need to do this step:

    pandoc: Cannot decode byte '\xb0': Data.Text.Encoding.Fusion.streamUtf8: Invalid UTF-8 stream


To re-encode a file as UTF-8, you need to use the `iconv` commandline tool.

    iconv -c -t "UTF-8" < input.html > output.asciidoc

For instance, if 164-h/164-h.htm

= Versioning Gitenberg books

Gitenberg uses http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] to describe the changes to books over time.
The current version of a GITenberg book is stored in two places:

+ On the 3rd line of the main book asciidoc file (prefixed with `v`)
+ As a git tag

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Title
Author
RevisionNumber, RevisionDate
----

A semantic version is in the format of `Major.Minor.Patch`.
The only agreed upon minor revision is a complete epub file built by travis as described in the https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/Second-Folio/[Second-Folio] collection.

For now, assume that your changes increment the `Patch` value.
`v0.0.23` would become `v0.0.24`

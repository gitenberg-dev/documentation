= Versioning Gitenberg books

Gitenberg uses http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] to describe the changes to books over time.
The current version of a GITenberg book is stored in three places:

+ As a git tag
+ As the value for `_version` in repo's link:metadata/pandata_attribute_dictionary.yaml[metadata.yaml]
+ On the 3rd line of the main book asciidoc file (prefixed with `v`)

Author
RevisionNumber, RevisionDate

A semantic version is in the format of `Major.Minor.Patch`.
The only agreed upon minor revision is a complete epub file built by travis as described in the https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/Second-Folio/[Second-Folio] collection.

For now, assume that your changes increment the `Patch` value.
`v0.0.23` would become `v0.0.24`
